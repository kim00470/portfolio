**The most challenging part** of creating this web portfolio was fine-tuning and aligning each element to my liking. It's something I've been doing for two semesters now, but just when I think I'm getting the hang of it, it always comes back to *harass* me in new ways and in places I never expected. As always, I was able to get through it with Chrome DevTools, Googling, and frequent breaks.

Following the accessibility guidelines I've learnt this semester is another thing that seemed complicated at first, with so many things to consider, but I'm gradually becoming more comfortable with it. :joy:
